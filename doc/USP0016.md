# USP0016 Suppress NullableReferenceTypes warning (CS8618) for fields and properties that cannot be initialized and check for assignment to these in Unity's initialization methods or inspector

Initialization of types inheriting from UnityEngine.Object is not supported and will result in errors.

## Suppressed Diagnostic ID

CS8618  -  Non-nullable field '{0}' is uninitialized. Consider declaring the field as nullable.

## Examples of code that produces a suppressed diagnostic
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Test : Monobehaviour
{
	private GameObject field;
	
	private void Start()
	{
		Initialize();
	}
	
	private void Initialize()
	{
		field = new GameObject();
	}
}
```
and:
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Test : Monobehaviour
{
	public GameObject Property { get; set; }
	
	private void Awake()
	{
		Property = GameObject.Find("Player");
	}
}
```
and:
```csharp
using UnityEngine;

public class Test : Monobehaviour
{
	[SerializeField] private UnityEngine.Object serializedField;
}
```
## Why is the diagnostic reported?

The IDE cannot detect that types inheriting 'UnityEngine.Object' cannot be initialized.

## Why do we suppress this diagnsotic?

Fields or properties of such types cannot be initialized next to their declaration but can be assigned to in Unity's initialization methods such as 'OnEnable()', 'Awake()', and 'Start()' or all methods called by these, or the inspector.
